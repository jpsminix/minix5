This files are the initramfs. This are the basics ones:
 - initramfs.cpio.gz
 - initramfs.cpio (uncompresed only)

(USE THIS) And this its the same but i added the module rk30_nand (for use the nand on start):
 - initramfs_rk.cpio.gz
 - initramfs_rk.cpio

###
The best config that i have try is saved as:
LAST_CONFIG_11-08-2022_ONLY_LEFT_VPU

For use this (copy on the path of source kernel):
cp LAST_CONFIG_11-08-2022_ONLY_LEFT_VPU .config

####
I rememeber that i have done a little modifications over original source code from repository of ANDREWDB. 
This modifications are minor (as when u compile and get an error). The only one i remember that is bigger,
is the disp_ump module that i have copied from OLEGK0 source.

####
I have used the sources from OLEGK0, but i have got many errors from mali drivers, SO i used the android 
binary modules (copied to my ubuntu version) and loaded. Same for wireless driver.

####
REMEMBER that our Minix x5 use the WM8326 power module chip that IS DIFFERENT from TPS6xxxx of MK808 (this
is why the other kernels dont work at all on our minix). DONT ENABLE TPS or you will get a kernel image that
crash on start.

You need to install a cross compiler to compile ARM code on X86 processor (of your PC).
 - export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi-

NOTE: The "-j12" option its mean the number of processor you have x2. I have 6 cpu x2 =12

Basics commands on kernel compilation (all this is a example of one of my compilations):
 - kerneldir=<your_kernel_dir>
 - cd $kerneldir
 - make mrproper
 - cp LAST_CONFIG_11-08-2022_ONLY_LEFT_VPU .config
 - make menuconfig

Here you get the zImage file for the boot.img:
 - KDIR=./ make arch=ARM -j12 zImage

Next you get the boot.img file:
 - ./mkbootimg --kernel arch/arm/boot/zImage --ramdisk initramfs_rk.cpio.gz --base 60400000 --pagesize 16384 --ramdiskaddr 62000000 -o ~/boot.img

For modules (i install this on another path for take it easy and not in /lib of your sistem)
 - KDIR=./ make arch=ARM -j12 modules && make -j12 modules_install INSTALL_MOD_PATH=./MOD/

I hope this notes help you. Keep holding on!
